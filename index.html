        <p>How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Imagination is the key to painting. Let's have a happy little tree in here.</p>
